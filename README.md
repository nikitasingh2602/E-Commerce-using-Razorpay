# E-commerce Platform

## Summary

This E-commerce platform is a full-stack project designed to provide a seamless online shopping experience. Developed using Next.js, React, and MongoDB, it features a comprehensive storefront and an admin page. The admin access is secured with a password (0000), allowing administrators to manage products and orders efficiently. Tailored for both vendors and customers, this platform stands out with its intuitive design and robust functionality.

## Challenge Faced
A major challenge in this project was the integration of admin functionalities with the store. The initial goal was to enable subscribed users to post products. However, we adopted a password-protected admin system to ensure secure and efficient management of the store's inventory and orders.

## Features
Admin Access
Security: Admin page secured with a password (0000) for product and order management.
Storefront
User Experience: Responsive and intuitive interface using Next.js and Tailwind UI.
Product Management
Functionality: Allows admins to add, modify, and remove products easily.
Payment Integration
Reliability: Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing.
User Authentication
Robust System: Managed by NextAuth.
Responsive Design
Compatibility: Ensures a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
Next.js: The React framework for production-grade applications.
React: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Tailwind UI: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
Stripe: For secure online payment processing.
NextAuth: For authentication and authorization.
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
